# The EpiVar Browser

A federated web application to search for eQTL/epigenetic signal-associated variants and 
merge bigWig tracks by genotype. 

A production instance with data from 
[Aracena *et al.* (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01668-z)
is available at 
[https://computationalgenomics.ca/tools/epivar](https://computationalgenomics.ca/tools/epivar). 

The tool itself is described in a 2023 preprint:

### Note on hosting your own node

The EpiVar Browser's server component can be deployed with other data than just
the Aracena *et al.* dataset. The instructions below must be followed,
paying especially close attention to the formats described the 
[node setup guide](/docs/setting_up_a_node.md).
